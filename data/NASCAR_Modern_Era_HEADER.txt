Open Data Questions:

- The Data appears to start in 1968 at Macon but was described as starting in 1972. Should the '68-'71 races be discarded as not modern era NASCAR?
- What are the asterisks in column 'Car' represent e.g. *06 for Castles in '68
- Is there any difference between "BUI" or "bui" in 'Make'?
- What does the 'Pts' category represent?
- What does the 'LL' category represent?
- What does the second 'Out' column represent? It appears to have something to do with Miles?
- Someone appears to have been born after their race (they have a negative 'age')?
- What does the final '*' column represent?
